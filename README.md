- 👋 Hi, I’m @dmmcclain01
- 👀 I’m interested in ... general code and full-stack.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... everything! I'm learning through Skillcrush as I've found it to be the easiest platform, and it's extremely easy to work with their team. I learn, take time off, and repeat!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... hmmm, right now I'm still learning, so any collaboration that can continue to educate me, but has a team that understands I'm still figuring it out!
- 📫 How to reach me ... email me here - dannie@danniemcclain.com - and I'll get it.
